          <p>
            Inquisitive, determined and multifaceted are three things that describe the physicists at the
            University of Helsinki well. Physics students are curious and independent learners who posess
            strong skills in mathematics and problem solving after graduating. Our multifield campus has a
            strong community of physicists who have internalised many important skills from programming to
            frankly diamond standard collaboration skills as there's such a small amount of us who manage
            with their studies all by themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kumpula's physicists' special skills include atmospheral sciences, computational data science,
            material research as well as many others. Gratuated physicists know-how is often even broader.
            the modern world wouldn't work without a grounded understanding of physical phenomena, which
            the physics students at the University of Helsinki study, research and apply each day.

          <p>
            Geophysicists have a wide skillset researching our planet. Geophysics can be divided into two main branches,
            the geophysics of solid ground and the geophysics of the water jacket. Geophysicists of solid ground research
            earthquakes, tectonic plates, the magnetism of rocks as well as geothermics. While the research subjects are
            similar to those of geology, the research methods include a strong inclination of applying physics and modeling.
          </p>
          <p>
             The geophysicists of the water jacket by definition research the water bodies of our planet. Their specialities
             include knowledge in surface-, sea- and ground waters as well as glaciers. In practise they can specialize in
             whichever field where there is water. Geophysicists specializing in the water jacket have played a key role
             in climat change research.
          </p>
          <p>
            So all geophysicists are united by the aim to understand our planet with methods related to physics.
            Key knowlegde areas are modeling phenomena as well as measurements done in the field. Geophysicists are excellent
            in field work as they graduate to conduct brilliant measurements even under extreme conditions.

            Geology studies the processes the earth's core and it's physical evolution. Thus geologists posess a great amount of
            know-how not only in utilizing mineral on ground water reserves but also in solving climate-related problems and
            researching climate change. Bachelor studies give the students an understanding of our planet's crusts processes as well as
            utilizing and mapping out geologic natural resources. Minor studies comprise out of chemistry, mathematics, physics and
            formal sciences. GIS studies during the bachelor mean that geologists are able and capable in map creating and
            laboratory work. Master-level students can work independently in the laboratory and field.

            To success in chemistry, students must pocess practical and theoretical knowledge. To achieve this, chemistry
            studies at the University of Helsinki branch out into deepening the theoretical base with laboratory work,
            which is an integral part of the whole degree. This is why a chemistry student can work safely in a laboratory
            already after the first year.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the second year, students can work independently in labs and can already possess interscientific knowledge
            and know-how. Chemistry students' minor subjects are well spread throughout different fields, but examples could be
            computer science, physics, pharmacology, biology among others. Master's students specialize into some field of chemistry,
            such as molecular science, material studies, radiochemistry and computational chemistry.

            Conginiton science looks at phenomena concerning information such as perception, learning, memory, language, thought
            and problem solving. Students of cognition science possess a diverse set of skills which can be utilized in fields like
            usability consulting to AI research adn from philosophical brain analysis to computer science. Because of the field's
            versatility, continion scientists have a strong interdisciplinary know-how and a skill to work as a joining link between
            different study fields at the work place and in a research group.

          <p>
            The absolute best thing geographers have to offer is the ability to understand the world and its phenomena as a whole.
            During their first year, students go through the field of cartography and methods of geoinformatics. During the later years
            students dive deeper into their specialization field such as regional and city planning and geoinformatics. Geography studies
            prepare students for raporting and organizing projects through various field and project courses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Visual representation of statistics and regional information as well as creating beautiful maps are part of geographers'
            skill set. Method studies of geography are uniquely extensive as students learn quantitative and qualitative methods
            alongside geoinformatics. The different options for minor studies are vast and extremely open which lead to pesonal study
            curriculums and high motivation amongst students. For instance, geographers study computer sceince, statistics, biology and
            social sciences.

          <p>
            Mathematics studens begin their studies by detaching themselves from high school math with proofs adn new definitions.
            During the first year, students achieve a good level in mathematics with basic understanding in multiple fields of the science.
            The second and third year of studies focus on deepening skills and extending them to interdisciplinary fields as well. A mathematicians
            best tool for everyday problems is a methematical though process which leads to logical and organized work and problem solving.
          </p>
          <p>
            Specialization takes place during the third and fourth years of studies. It's about at that point when math students choose
            their field of study and become real professionals in analytics, logic or other fields. Studies from other sciences also
            helps turning a mathematician into valuable real estate in the IT field as well as in more traditional fields.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most common minors amongst mathematicians are computer science, statistics, physics and economics.

            Meteorology students are multifaceted pros of atmospheral sciences. Their know-how extends all the way from singular
            particle sizes to planetary waves splitting our planet. During their first years of studying, meteologists must acquire a
            steady base in physics and computation to succeed in their future studies. On of these skills is getting a basic understanging
            of programming. While programming is mandatory as a course for meteoroly students, a large percentage learn to use and write
            multiple programming languages. MATLAB, Python and Fortran are the languages that become especially important to multiple
            students during their studies.
         </p>
         <p>
           Nowadays meteorology students possess a stong working knowledge of the whole field when get their bachelor after which
           they can specialize in	dynamic (large scale) or micro meteorology. As a result of their studies, meteorologists are
           professionals for instance in climate change research. Also, combining meteorologists' clear understanding of the atmosphere
           with computational know-how can be also used in demanding data analysis positions as well as the energy industry.

            Computer science studies start off from the basics of programming but diversify towards harder and more interesting
            aspects quickly. Helsinki University provides an opportunity for computer scientists to build their expertise for
            instance in algorithms and machine learning, networking, services and software systems as well as in data science and
            data analysis.

          <p>
            A statistician is specialized in making conclusions even during uncertaint situations. Because uncertainty arises
            almost everywhere in the world, the skills statisticians possess are essential in every field of work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Uncertainty is addressed at the University of Helsinki using a grounded base in mathematics. Statisticians can
            use a theoretical background in practise while understanding the models they use. This means that many kinds on phenomena
            can be described clearly and concisely.
          </p>
          <p>
            Statisticians are especially skilled in the R programming language as programming as a whole is in a central rose
            in applying statistical methods. Not very surprisingly many statisticians have computer science as their minor as well.

            Astronomers are future professional of physical sciences as the physical phenomena doesn't end with the atmosphere.
            Usually astronomers go through basics in physics as well as astronomy during their first year after which
            they branch out into different fields of study. A large amount of astronomers also learn aspects of computer science and
            statistics among their studies in astronomy and physical sciences.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the university's degree reforms astronomers at the University of Helsinki will share master's studies with
            cosmologists as well as particle physicists because of the similarities of the fields.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like many other students at Kumpula campus, astronomers possess advanced problem solving skills and an ability
            to learn new complex things fast. Many astronomy students have good and practical abilities in mathematics and
            a steady background in programming and multiple programming languages.
